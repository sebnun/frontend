## Running locally

To run this app locally use this command:

`git clone https://github.com/sebnun/frontend.git && cd frontend && npm install && npm start`

A browser window/tab should open at `http://localhost:3000`

## Tests

I have included some basic component tests using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
To run them use this command:

`npm run test`
